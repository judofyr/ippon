# Ippon: Web development the gentle way

Ippon is a library of small modules (50 to 500 lines of code) which are useful
for web development.

Under development:

- {Ippon::Migrator}: Migration system built on Sequel.
- {Ippon::Validate}: Form validation.
- {Ippon::FormData}: Type-safe interface to form data.
- {Ippon::Paginator}: Calculates pagination information.

## Features

- Framework-agnostic. Works whether you use Rails, Sinatra, Roda, Hanami or Camping.
- Well-documented public API with stable versioning.
- Modules are object-oriented, not DSL magic.
- Modules are mostly independent of each other. You don't need to understand
  everything in Ippon to use one part.
- 100% test coverage. 100% documentation coverage.
- No dependencies. (Although some modules integrate with other gems.)
- Cross-platform forever. No C/Java extensions.
